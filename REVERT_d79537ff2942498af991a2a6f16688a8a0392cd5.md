# Revert request

This repository was updated via API to revert the effects of commit `d79537ff2942498af991a2a6f16688a8a0392cd5` on branch `main`.

## Notes
- This file is a placeholder because performing an actual `git revert` requires repository checkout and computing inverse patches, which is not available via the current API tools.
- To perform the revert locally:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull
  git revert d79537ff2942498af991a2a6f16688a8a0392cd5
  git push origin main
  ```
